# Deep-Learning-for-Inverse-Problems
This project hosts the code and datasets I used for Deep Learning course at Boston University. It aims to post-process the images the low quality images produced as a result of solving inverse problems in imaging (particularly Computed Tomography) and produce high-quality images.
